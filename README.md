# BBC-iWonder-Clone
HTML/CSS page cloning exercise

This is the first big coding challenge from the Complete Front End Web Development course on StackSkills. It is meant to utilize basic
HTML/CSS skills to clone a page off the BBC News website and is not meant to be fully responsive as we have not officially covered that in the course up to this point. 

I opted to choose a page that was outside of what the course director specified to give myself a harder challenge and only rely
on the course videos in the event I absolutely could not figure out what I was doing. Outside of those situations- which there has yet
to be one- I rely only on Google searching or using the Chrome Inspector to figure things out.
